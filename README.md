# python-utility-scripts
Python repository for utility scripts.

## Getting Started
This repository will contain scripts made in Python, which have been created as practices of this language or to solve problems or automate tasks that I have been finding in my day to day.

The scripts that are included are:

### Json Minifier
This script will be responsible for minifying, ie eliminating line breaks and spaces, of a JSON whose URL can be indicated.

```
py -c "python -c 'import jsonMinifier; jsonMinifier.json_minifier()'
```

### Redmine - Trello Integration
#### Create Trello Card.
Script in charge of generating a new board in Trello to manage a task of Redmine, creating a card for each of the children tasks.

```
py -c "python -c 'import redmineTrelloIntegration; redmineTrelloIntegration.redmine_card_creation()'
```
